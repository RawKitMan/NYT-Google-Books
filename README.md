# NYT-Google-Books

This is Google Books, a full stack application utilizing React.js, Mongoose, Google Books API and Bootstrap. When opening the app, the user can search for books listed in Google Books. Using the Google Books API, the app will generate a list of books based on the search term provided. Each book contains the image of the book, title, author(s), and the book's description. If the user likes a particular book, they can save it by clicking the associated save button. Then they can access the Saved page via the Navbar and find all the books they've saved. If they want to remove the book from the list, simply click Remove. 

The only improvements I would make is some styling here and there. Perhaps a different font family and a little more color. But overall, this is a fully functional app.
